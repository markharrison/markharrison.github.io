### Its a tug of war over finite time and resources

Technical debt = try to keep the lights on

- Messy / unmanaged codebase and poor processes 
- Lack of knowledge, maybe developers long gone … bugs are hard to solve, can’t extend with new functionality
- Using old frameworks / libraries / operating systems – maybe not supported / updated (so possibly contains security issues)
- On premise – spend time looking after infrastructure, e.g. patch systems, backup data, protect networks, etc. 

Innovation = Improve outcomes & differentiated value

- Build applications that innovate, differentiate and disrupt … provide business advantage over competitors. e.g. infuse AI
- Deploy In the cloud using cloud-native / serverless technologies … more cost effective, greener software
- Use proven libraries / frameworks / SDKs / patterns / ref architectures … don’t put efforts into something someone else has solved/maintaining. e.g. modern authentication
- Implement DevSecOps / platform engineering … build high quality secure software, save costs, accelerates delivery

App modernization aims to reduces technical debt, unlocking time and resources so teams can focus on activities that add business value.
