Sharing a recent session where I discussed the Model Context Protocol, and covered:

- Why is there a need for MCP
- What MCP is, including its architecture and core components
- A demo of MCP — including how to configure it so anyone can run it
- An example of how to develop an MCP server — a potential starter project for connecting to your own knowledge resources
